# LP24-Project

### What is "Arbhres"?

Arbhres is a school project initiated during the LP24 UV, a course dedicated to Oriented Object Programming in UTBM. The goal of the project was to create "something like the game 2048". We decided then to create a game like the "Threes!" (the one that inspired the 2048 creator) and we decided to add things like bonuses or gamemodes. And that's kids how Arbhres was born!
